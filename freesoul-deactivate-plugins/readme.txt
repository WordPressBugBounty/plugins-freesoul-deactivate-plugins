Load plugins only where you need them. No bloat, no conflicts, more speed. Deactivate plugins where they don't add anything useful.

== Disable plugins on individual WordPress pages ==

FDP allows you to **deactivate plugins on specific pages** for <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/speed+optimization/">speed optimization</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/debugging/">debugging</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/problem-solving/">problem-solving</a>.

It works for every page, blog posts, custom posts that are publicly queryable, archives and backend pages.

Turning off plugins selectively can improve the performance, but also solve conflicts between plugins.

For large or business-critical WordPress sites, using FDP is not just an optimization — it is an essential part of a clean, <a href="https://josemortellaro.com/what-is-possible-with-wordpress-for-complex-systems-and-what-really-matters/">high-performance architecture</a>.

== 🚀 Deactivate plugins on specific pages to improve the performance ==

With FDP you can **disable the entire plugins** where you don't need them. It will not only **clean up the assets** of third-party plugins, their PHP code will not run either. Hence, your pages will have **fewer HTTP requests and fewer database queries**.

You will **improve the TTFB (time to first byte) also when the page is not served by cache**.

Usually, the number of the needed plugin on a specific page is lower than the number of globally active plugins.

Why don't you keep the plugins active only on the pages where you need them?

Most of the plugins load their assets and query the database on all the pages, no matter if they do something useful. This causes many times a worsening of the performance.

With FDP no matter how many plugins you have, you can keep them active only where you need them.

== 🥊 Deactivate plugins on specific pages to solve conflicts between plugins ==
With FDP you can preview the page loading specific plugins. This is very useful to detect which plugin is causing issues.

Look <a href="https://freesoul-deactivate-plugins.com/how-check-which-plugin-causes-issues/">How to check which plugin is causing issues in 1 minute</a> for more details.

If on a specific page you keep active only the plugins that you really need, most of the time the probability of having conflicts between plugins is lower.

== 🧹 📱 Clean up on mobile ==
FDP allows you to disable specific plugins for mobile devices. But if you disable a plugin on mobile, that plugin will be disabled on all the pages on mobile.
If you want to selectively disable plugins on mobile pages, you can install <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/specific-content-for-mobile/">Specific Content For Mobile</a> that is fully integrated with FDP.
If you create mobile versions with SCFM, you will find the mobile pages in the FDP Singles settings. There you can disable plugins as you do with normal desktop pages.
FDP and SCFM together are powerful tools to selectively clean up mobile pages.
If you clean up the mobile, remember to set up your <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/cache/">caching plugin</a> to separate the desktop and mobile cache, in another case you may have issues.
For instance <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/">W3 Total Cache</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-fastest-cache/">WP Fastest Cache</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/powered-cache/">Powered Cache</a>, and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/litespeed-cache/">LiteSpeed Cache</a> are caching plugins that can serve a different cache on mobile.


== ⚠ Requirements ==
Only the permalink structures "Day and name", "Month and name", "Post name"  and the custom ones ending with "%postname%" are supported for permanently deactivating plugins (they are also better for SEO).

You will not be able to disable plugins in a permanent way with other permalink structures.

The same if you are using plugins to change the permalinks, e.g., Permalink Manager Lite.
